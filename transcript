My name is Hailey Spillers, and I am 18 years old. I am from Terry, Mississippi and recently graduated from Terry High School. I aspire to go to medical school and become a pathologist. This fall, I will be attending Mississippi State University, majoring in Biochemistry. Because of my parentsâ€™ service in the US Army National Guard, I also want to work with veterans and to help improve their quality of mental and physical healthcare. Some other fields that I am interested in are related to sustainability, and I hope to enter into research that is related to this topic.
